# About This Book 

This is a Live Book (pull requests will be accepted and included on an ongoing basis) about Software Poo Patterns that can be found in real (and sometimes even popular) software projects (even better if they are Open Source and actual examples/references can be given). 

Let's try to collect all of them in one place (for the children!).
